RAG_LLM
This repository provides an overview of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs). RAG is an AI framework that enhances the performance of LLMs by incorporating information from external knowledge sources.

Steps Followed:

Data Development:

Synthetic Data Generation:

- macro_1.csv: Contains state-level GDP, population, and PCC category data.
- media_1.csv: Provides information on media spending, platform, duration, and geography.
- business_performance_1.csv: Includes data on value and volume sales, business entity, and geography.
- weather_1.csv: Offers temperature, rainfall, duration, and geography data.

Data Exploration:

Refer to data_generator_1.ipynb for detailed data exploration.

RAG Implementation with LLM:

- Data Preparation:

Prepare and preprocess data as necessary.
Embedding Development:

- Create embeddings for data representation.
- Pinecone Integration:

Connect embeddings to Pinecone for efficient retrieval.
- Prompt Engineering:

Experiment with various prompt types: zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thoughts, and self-consistency.
Refer to Prompt_Engineering.docx for detailed prompt engineering guidelines.
Context Retrieval:

- Input a query and retrieve relevant contexts based on similarity search.
Select contexts with lower scores for higher relevance.
- LLM-based Response Generation:

- Provide the retrieved context along with the query to the LLM to generate a response.
- Hallucination Detection and Reward Function Implementation:

Identify and address hallucinations in LLM responses.
Implement reward functions to train a reinforcement learning model.
Assign -1 for incorrect rewards and +1 for correct rewards.
